To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

- cd enviroment
- npm start
- npm run android
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
- npm run web

If it asks you to download any dependencies just run the command it tells you

If you get the error "'expo' is not recognized as an internal or external command,"
run then 'npm install' command
